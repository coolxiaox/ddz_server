                   the server and displays the response.
                   Start with argument 6 to use IPv6, otherwise use IPv4
testsrv_udp.lua    like testsrv_tcp.lua, just for udp
testclt_udp.lua    like testclnt_tcp.lua, just for udp
testsrv_mcast.lua  a very simple multicast server, sends a counter.
                   Start with argument 6 to use IPv6 multicast, otherwise
                   use IPv4 broadcast
testclt_mcast.lua  a very simple multicast client, displays what it
                   receives from the server.
                   Start with argument 6 to use IPv6 multicast, otherwise

httpserver.lua     a very simple http server, uses the rshttpd.lua library
                   to do the real work.
rshttpd.lua        a ridiculously simple http server library. Documentation
                   is in the comment at the beginning.

httpclient.lua     a simple http client. Call with the complete url you
                   want to fetch, httpclient.lua then issues a GET request
                   to the server at the specified address and prints the
                   data it receives to the standard output.
